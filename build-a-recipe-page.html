        <h2> Ingredients </h2>

          <img src="https://preppykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Belgian-Waffle-R-Ingredient.jpg">
          <li><h5>All-purpose flour:</h5>plain flour is perfect for waffle batter for creating tender waffles with a crispy exterior.</li>
          <li><h5>Baking powder:</h5>When paired with whipped egg whites, this leavening agent creates tiny air pockets throughout the batter, making super fluffy waffles.</li>
          <li><h5>Milk:</h5>feel free to use any percentage of dairy milk or any unsweetened plant-based milk you prefer.</li>
          <li><h5>Neutral oil:</h5>I typically reach for vegetable or canola oil, but avocado or grapeseed will also work beautifully.</li>
          <li><h5>Eggs:</h5>you’ll need to separate the yolks and whites (yolks add tenderness, while whipped whites add fluffiness). I prefer separating them cold as the egg white is a bit thicker, and the yolk is less likely to break</li
          <li><h5>Vanilla extract:</h5>for added richness and warmth. Feel free to swap in an equal amount of vanilla paste or powder, or use half as much ground vanilla bean instead</li>
          </ul>
<h2> Instructions </h2>

  <li>Preheat your Belgian waffle iron. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.</li>

  <li>Gently fold the egg whites into the waffle batter until no streaks remain.</li>
  <li>Scoop about 1/3 cup of Belgian waffle batter for each waffle. (This will depend on the size and settings of your waffle maker, so feel free to experiment with amounts.) Cook according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serve hot with butter, syrup, berries, whipped cream, or your favorite toppings.</li> <img src="https://preppykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Belgian-Waffle-Process-3.jpg" alt="sixth process">
