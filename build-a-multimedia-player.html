    <p>
      The map() method is one of the most useful array methods in JavaScript. 
      It creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function 
      on every element in the calling array. It doesn't modify the original array.
      <br><br>
      For example, if you have an array of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] and you want to double each value, 
      you can write: numbers.map(num =&gt; num * 2). This returns a new array [2, 4, 6, 8].
      <br><br>
      The callback function receives three arguments: the current element, its index, 
      and the array itself. You can also pass an optional thisArg as the second parameter 
      to map() to set the value of 'this' inside the callback.
      <br><br>
      Common use cases include transforming data, extracting specific properties from objects, 
      formatting values, or preparing data for rendering in UI frameworks like React.
